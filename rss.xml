            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3b53f341e9bfa1b291542ff36d386f62/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--KJc-Uo0o--%2Fc_scale%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fssbcmy6vcoq8ggiiinid.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
