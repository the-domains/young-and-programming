  'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've
  been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested
  in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of
  contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's
  electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes
  and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and
  functions.
